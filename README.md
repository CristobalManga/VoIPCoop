# VoIPCoop
VoIPCoop is Voice Chat LAN
With this app, you can talk to other people via LAN, either locally or through a VPN.

Instructions:

Since I don't have the money to sign the Windows app, you'll get a warning that it's a corrupted app. Click Show More and open it anyway.

You must also open it as an administrator so it can open the ports this app will use. You only need to do this once.
